## Local Variables

Declared inside a method, constructor, or block

Exist only while that method is executing

Stored on the stack


**example:**

```
public void loginTest() {
    String username = "testUser";   // local variable
    String password = "test123";    // local variable

    System.out.println(username);
}
```


## Instance Variables

Declared inside a class but outside methods

Belong to the object

Stored in heap memory

**example:**

```
class LoginPage {
    WebDriver driver;   // instance variable

    LoginPage(WebDriver driver) {
        this.driver = driver;
    }
}
```


| Feature         | Local Variable      | Instance Variable |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| Declaration     | Inside method/block | Inside class      |
| Scope           | Method/block only   | Entire object     |
| Lifetime        | Method execution    | Object lifetime   |
| Memory          | Stack               | Heap              |
| Default Value   | ❌ No                | ✔ Yes             |
| Access Modifier | ❌ Not allowed       | ✔ Allowed         |
| `this` keyword  | ❌ Not applicable    | ✔ Applicable      |


## static

Static members belong to the **class**, not to objects.

They are created once when the class is loaded by the JVM and **shared by all objects**

**ex:**

```
public class student{

int id ;
String name;
Static college ="JNTUA";
public student(int id, string name){
this.id=id;
this.name=name;
}
public static void main(String[] args){
student s1= new Student(111,"Ram");
student s2= new Student(112,"Don");
student.college;
}
}
```

## Non‑static (instance)

Belongs to: **objects**

Each object has its own copy of non‑static fields

You must create an object with **new** to use them


### Note:

Static = shared global state

Shared global state = dangerous in multi‑threaded / parallel test environments

You might later refactor to:

Use **ThreadLocal<WebDriver>** with static getter methods, or

Pass driver as a **non‑static field** to each **Page Object** instance


### 1. What is the difference between static and non‑static variables?

Key points:

**Static variables:**

Belong to the class, not to any object

Shared across all instances

Accessed via ClassName.variable

**Non‑static variables:**

Belong to each object

Each object has its own copy

Require an instance to access

### 2. Can a static method access non‑static variables? Why or why not?

Static method cannot directly access non‑static fields/methods.

Because static methods **don’t have a this** object.

They must either:

Create an instance, or

Be passed an instance.

You can say:

“Static methods don’t belong to any specific object, so they can’t access instance fields which require a particular object. Instance methods, on the other hand, can access both.”

### 3.When would you use static in a test automation framework?

**Utility classes:**

WaitUtils, JsonUtils, DateUtils, AssertionUtils

**Shared constants:**

public static final String BASE_URL

**Global counters / IDs:**

For unique test data generation

ThreadLocal driver managers (careful design)

You should add:

“But I’d be careful using static for WebDriver or mutable shared state in parallel tests, because static data can cause interference between tests.”

### 4.What are the risks of using static variables in tests?

If we store WebDriver or test state in static variables, multiple tests might accidentally share the same state.

 In parallel runs, this can cause flakiness where one test closes the driver while another still uses it.

That’s why static should be used carefully and usually only for constants or stateless utilities.”

### 5. Can constructors be static? Why not?

No, constructors cannot be static.

Constructors are called when creating an object, and static means “belongs to the class, not to instances.”

You create objects with new ClassName(), which triggers constructor, not via static calls.

### 6. What is a static block and where might you use it?

A static block is: Used for complex static initialization.
```
static {
    // runs once when the class is loaded
}
```

SDET example:

“I might use a static block in a Config class to initialize static fields like BASE_URL, reading from system properties or environment variables once at startup.”
