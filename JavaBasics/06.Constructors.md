# Constructors

## What is a Constructor in Java?

A constructor is a **special method**-like block that **runs automatically when you create an object using new**. It initializes the object’s state.

### Key points
```
Same name as the class

No return type (not even void)

Called automatically when you do new ClassName(...)

Used to initialize fields so the object starts in a valid state
```

## Default Constructor(implicit)

If you don’t write any constructor, Java gives you a default constructor with no arguments that does nothing except call super() and let fields take default values

**example:**

```
class Ticket {
    int ticketId;
    String status;

    Ticket() {
        status = "OPEN";
    }
}
```

**Note:** If you define any constructor yourself, Java will not create a default one for you anymore.

## Parameterized Constructor (Most Used)

A parameterized constructor **takes arguments** and uses them to initialize the object

**example:**

```
class Ticket {
    int ticketId;
    String vehicleNumber;
    String location;

    Ticket(int id, String vehicle, String loc) {
        ticketId = id;
        vehicleNumber = vehicle;
        location = loc;
    }
}
```

**usage:**

```
Ticket t1 = new Ticket(101, "MH12AB1234", "Akron, OH");
```

## Constructor Overloading

Constructor overloading = same class, multiple constructors with different parameter lists.

```
class Ticket {

    Ticket() {
        status = "OPEN";
    }

    Ticket(int id) {
        ticketId = id;
        status = "OPEN";
    }

    Ticket(int id, String loc) {
        ticketId = id;
        location = loc;
        status = "OPEN";
    }
}
```

**usage:**

```
Ticket t = new Ticket(); //default constructor

Ticket t = new Ticket(109); //parameterized with one argument

Ticket t = new Ticket(12345,"BLR"); //parameterized with two arguments

```

We overload constructors to support multiple ways of creating the same object depending on context.

## **this** Keyword in Constructor and Constructor chaining with this()

`this` refers to current object

To avoid duplicate logic inside constructors, you can **call one constructor from another using this**(...). This is called **constructor chaining**

### example:

```
public class Config {
    int timeout;
    String env;

    public Config() {
        this("QA");          // calls second constructor
    }

    public Config(String env) {
        this(30, env);       // calls third constructor
    }

    public Config(int timeout, String env) {
        this.timeout = timeout;
        this.env = env;
    }
}
```

this(...) must be the first statement in the constructor.

Helps avoid repeating initialization logic.


## `Super` keyword and inheritance

In inheritance, the child constructor always calls a parent constructor, either:

Explicitly via `super(...)`, or

Implicitly via `super()` if you don’t write it.

**example:**

```
public class BasePage {
    WebDriver driver;

    public BasePage(WebDriver driver) {
        this.driver = driver;
    }
}

public class LoginPage extends BasePage {

    public LoginPage(WebDriver driver) {
        super(driver);   // calling BasePage constructor
    }
}
```

super() calls parent constructor

Must be first statement

If not written, Java adds it automatically


## constructor vs method

| Constructor             | Method            |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| Same name as class      | Any name          |
| No return type          | Has return type   |
| Called automatically    | Called explicitly |
| Used for initialization | Used for behavior |


## this vs super

| Constructor call                | Calls another constructor in the **same class** using `this()` | Calls parent class constructor using `super()`       |
| Position in constructor         | Must be **first statement** if used                            | Must be **first statement** if used                  |
| Variable shadowing              | Resolves conflict between local and instance variables         | Resolves conflict between parent and child variables |

### 1.Can a constructor be overridden?

Answer:
❌ No, constructors cannot be overridden because:

They are not inherited

They are tied to class creation

✔ They can be overloaded

### 2.What happens if this() and super() are both used?

❌ Compile-time error

Reason:

Both must be the first statement

Only one allowed

### 3.Can a constructor be final, static, or abstract?

static? No. Constructors are tied to object creation, and static belongs to the class, not object.

final? No. Final means “cannot be overridden”, but constructors are not inherited and thus not overridden.

abstract? No. Abstract means “must be implemented in a subclass”, but constructors are never inherited and don’t participate in polymorphism.

So: constructors cannot be static, final, or abstract.
