# final

final is a **keyword**

## What Does final Mean in Java?

`final` means cannot be changed once assigned.

But how it behaves depends on where it is used:

Variable

Method

Class

**final variable** → its reference/value cannot be reassigned

**final method** → cannot be overridden in a subclass

**final class** → cannot be extended (no subclass)

So final is a **restriction keyword** that helps you:

Create **constants**

Enforce **immutability**

Lock down behavior and inheritance for critical parts of the system


## final Variable 

Real-Time Example (Framework Config)

```
public class Config {
    public static final String BASE_URL = "https://test.app";
}
```

What final ensures:

✔ Value cannot be reassigned
✔ Prevents accidental changes
✔ Thread-safe constant


Important Interview Trap
```
final List<String> users = new ArrayList<>();
users.add("admin"); // ✔ allowed
users = new ArrayList<>(); // ❌ not allowed
```

📌 final locks the **reference**, not the object.

## final Instance Variables (Immutability)
```
final class User {
    private final String username;
    private final String role;

    User(String username, String role) {
        this.username = username; //assigned at constructor
        this.role = role;
    }
}
```


✔ User object cannot change
✔ Safe in parallel execution
✔ Clean test design

##  final Method

A final method **cannot be overridden**.

```
class BaseLogin {
    final void login() {
        System.out.println("Standard login steps");
    }
}
```

✔ Ensures login flow is consistent
✔ Prevents test misuse

**Interview Note**

✔ Final methods can be inherited
❌ But cannot be overridden

## final Class

A final class **cannot be extended.**
```
public final class DriverUtils {
    private DriverUtils() {}

    public static void takeScreenshot() {}
}
```

✔ Prevents misuse
✔ Ensures controlled behavior



## Why final Is Important for SDET Roles

Parallel Execution Safety

final objects reduce shared mutable state

Fewer flaky tests

Framework Stability

Prevents accidental overrides

Enforces architecture rules

## final in Constructors

class Config {
    final String env;

    Config(String env) {
        this.env = env;
    }
}


✔ Must be initialized
✔ Cannot change later


### 1. What is the final keyword?

final restricts modification: variable reassignment, method overriding, or class inheritance.

### 2. Difference between final, finally, and finalize?

final → keyword to restrict modification (variables, methods, classes).

finally → block in exception handling that always runs (whether exception is thrown or not).

finalize() → method that was used by GC before object destruction (now deprecated and should not be used in modern code).


## Should WebDriver be final?

✔ Reference can be final
❌ Object state still changes

### How does final help in thread safety?

Prevents reassignment, reducing shared mutable state.
