# fibonacci series
The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the previous two numbers.

eg: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...

### logic

n1 = 0, n2 = 1 → starting numbers

Loop from 0 to n → ensures exactly n terms

Print n1 first → current Fibonacci number

Calculate sum → sum = n1 + n2

Update n1 and n2 → shift numbers for next iteration

```
package practice;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class FibonacciSeries {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("Enter no.of terms:");
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int n1=0, n2 =1;
		int sum = 0;
		System.out.println("fibonacci series is :");
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {
			System.out.println(n1 + " ");
			sum = n1+n2;
			n1=n2;
			n2=sum;
		}
		
	}

}
```

### output:

Enter no.of terms:
5
fibonacci series is :
0 
1 
1 
2 
3
