# factorial number

### Logic of the Program

Take a number n as input

Initialize a variable fact = 1

Use a loop from 1 to n

Multiply fact by the loop variable each time

Final value of fact is the factorial

```
package practice;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class FactorialNumber {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("Enter number :");
		int n= sc.nextInt();
		int fact =1;
		for(int i=1;i<=n;i++) {
			fact=fact*i;
		}
		System.out.println("Factorial of "+ n +" is " + fact);
	}

}
```

### output:

```
Enter number :
5
Factorial of 5 is 120
```


## Explanation

| i | fact calculation | fact |
| - | ---------------- | ---- |
| 1 | 1 × 1            | 1    |
| 2 | 1 × 2            | 2    |
| 3 | 2 × 3            | 6    |
| 4 | 6 × 4            | 24   |
| 5 | 24 × 5           | 120  |


o/p:  Factorial of 5 is 120


`int fact = 1;`

Factorial starts from 1

Multiplying by 0 would make result 0

`for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)`


Loop runs from 1 to n

Each number is multiplied to fact


## using while loop 

```
int fact = 1;
while (n > 0) {
    fact = fact * n;
    n--;
}
```
