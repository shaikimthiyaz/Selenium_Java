# What is a List?

A List in Java is an **ordered collection** that:

Maintains **insertion order**.

**Allows duplicate** elements.

Provides **index-based access.**

It is part of the Collections Framework and is an interface in java.util.

##  Why List is Needed

You are automating an e-commerce application.

Each test has steps:

Open browser

Login

Search product

Add to cart

➡ Steps must execute in order
➡ Steps can repeat
➡ Steps grow dynamically

❌ Array fails

✔ List solves it


Cart Items: When a user adds items to their cart, order matters and duplicates are allowed.

Use **ArrayList<String>** → ["Burger", "Pizza", "Burger"]


Recent Orders: You want to show the most recent orders first.

Use **LinkedList<String>** → ["Order#101", "Order#102", "Order#103"]


## List vs Array

| Feature       | Array    | List            |
| ------------- | -------- | --------------- |
| Size          | Fixed    | Dynamic         |
| Order         | ✔        | ✔               |
| Duplicates    | ✔        | ✔               |
| Methods       | Very few | Rich API        |
| Performance   | Fast     | Slight overhead |
| Framework use | ❌        | ✔               |

Arrays are static, Lists are dynamic and flexible.

| List Type  | Used In Real Projects? |
| ---------- | ---------------------- |
| ArrayList  | ✅ Most used            |
| LinkedList | ⚠ Special cases        |
| Vector     | ❌ Legacy               |
| Stack(LIFO )    | ⚠ Limited              |
