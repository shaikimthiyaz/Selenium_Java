## What Are Collections in Java?

Java Collections are a framework of classes and interfaces used to store, manipulate, and manage groups of objects dynamically.

Collections in Java are **data structures that store groups of objects**. 

They are part of the **java.util package** and provide interfaces and classes like List, Set, Map, etc.


### Real time Example

Imagine you are building an E-commerce application:

**Scenario**: You need to store a list of products in a shopping cart.

Here, you use a List<Product> because order matters and duplicates are allowed.
Example: ["Laptop", "Mouse", "Laptop"]

**Scenario**: You need to store unique categories of products.

Use a Set<String> because duplicates are not allowed.
Example: {"Electronics", "Fashion", "Home"}

**Scenario**: You need to map each product to its price.

Use a Map<String, Double> because you need key-value pairs.
Example: {"Laptop" -> 50000.0, "Mouse" -> 500.0}

## Key Interfaces

List → Ordered, allows duplicates (ArrayList, LinkedList)

Set → Unordered, no duplicates (HashSet, TreeSet)

Map → Key-Value pairs (HashMap, TreeMap)



| Array              | Collections  |
| ------------------ | ------------ |
| Fixed size         | Dynamic size |
| Limited methods    | Rich APIs    |
| Primitive support  | Objects only |
| Hard to manipulate | Easy         |

Map (Not part of Collection interface)
