# Abstract class

### What is an Abstract Class?

An abstract class is a **partially implemented class**.

👉 It can have:

Implemented methods (with body)

Unimplemented methods (abstract methods)

Variables

Constructors

👉 You cannot create an object of an abstract class.

### Why do we need Abstract Class?

When:

Some behavior is common

Some behavior must be customized by child classes

### Real-Life Example

Think of Vehicle:

All vehicles:

have fuel

can start engine

But:

How they run is different

### Java Example

```
abstract class Vehicle {

    // concrete method
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle started");
    }

    // abstract method
    abstract void run();
}
```

### child classes

```
class Car extends Vehicle {
    void run() {
        System.out.println("Car is running on 4 wheels");
    }
}

class Bike extends Vehicle {
    void run() {
        System.out.println("Bike is running on 2 wheels");
    }
}
```

### Main class

```
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle v1 = new Car();
        v1.start();
        v1.run();

        Vehicle v2 = new Bike();
        v2.start();
        v2.run();
    }
}
```

### output:

```
Vehicle started
Car is running on 4 wheels
Vehicle started
Bike is running on 2 wheels
```

### Key Points 

✔ Abstract class can have **both abstract & non-abstract methods**
✔ Can have **constructors**
✔ Can have instance variables
✔ Supports **single inheritance only**


# Interface

### What is an Interface?

An interface is a 100% contract.

👉 It tells what to do, not how to do.

Think:

“If you implement me, you MUST follow my rules.”

### Why do we need Interface?

When:

Different classes need to follow same behavior

No relation in class hierarchy

Need multiple inheritance

### Real-Life Example

Think of Payment System

All payments must:

pay()

But:

How payment happens is different

### Java Interface Example
```
interface Payment {
    void pay();
}
```

### Implementing classes

```
class GooglePay implements Payment {
    public void pay() {
        System.out.println("Paid using Google Pay");
    }
}

class CreditCard implements Payment {
    public void pay() {
        System.out.println("Paid using Credit Card");
    }
}
```

### main class 

```
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Payment p1 = new GooglePay();
        p1.pay();

        Payment p2 = new CreditCard();
        p2.pay();
    }
}
```

## Abstract class vs Interface

| Feature              | Abstract Class      | Interface           |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Methods              | Abstract + Concrete | Abstract only       |
| Variables            | Any type            | public static final |
| Constructor          | Yes                 | No                  |
| Multiple Inheritance | ❌ No                | ✅ Yes               |
| Keyword              | `extends`           | `implements`        |
| Purpose              | Base class          | Contract            |


### Give me a real-world example of interfaces in Java.

The Collections Framework is a great example.

List, Set, Map are interfaces.

Implementations include ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap.

This allows developers to code against the interface (List) and swap implementations easily without changing the rest of the code.

### When would you choose an interface over an abstract class?

Use an interface when you want to define a capability that multiple unrelated classes can implement.

Example: Runnable (threads), Comparable (sorting).

Use an abstract class when you want to share common state or behavior among related classes.

Example: Employee base class with fields like name and id.
