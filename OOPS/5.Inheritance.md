# Inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism where one class (child/subclass) **inherits the fields and methods of another class** (parent/superclass).

It lets you create new classes based on existing ones, reusing code and adding or changing behavior.

Inheritance is the process where one class acquires the properties and methods of another class.

**Superclass / Parent / Base class:** The existing class.

**Subclass / Child / Derived class:** The class that extends the superclass.

Keyword: **extends** is used to implement inheritance in Java

## Why Do We Need Inheritance?

Without inheritance:
❌ Code duplication
❌ Hard to maintain
❌ More errors

With inheritance:
✅ Code reuse
✅ Easy maintenance
✅ Less code
✅ Logical relationship

### example:

**parent class**

```
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Animal eats food");
    }
}
```

**child class**

```
class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```
**Main class**

```
Dog d = new Dog();
d.eat();   // inherited
d.bark();  // own method
```

## Types of Inheritance in Java

### Single inheritance – one parent, one child

class Dog extends Animal

```
class A {}
class B extends A {}
```

### Multilevel inheritance – chain of inheritance

class Animal → Mammal → Dog

```
class A {}
class B extends A {}
class C extends B {}
```

### Hierarchical inheritance – one parent, multiple children

class Animal → Dog, Cat, Cow

```
class A {}
class B extends A {}
class C extends A {}
```

Java does not support **multiple inheritance** of classes (one class extending two classes) to avoid ambiguity (“diamond problem”).

Multiple inheritance of type is **achieved** via **interfaces**.

```
class A {}
class B {}
class C extends A, B {} // ❌ Not allowed
```

## Method overriding

**parent class**

```
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes sound");
    }
}
```

**child class**

```
class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```
**main method**
```
Animal a = new Dog();
a.sound(); // Dog barks
```
Runtime polymorphism using inheritance

## Important keywords in inheritance

**extends** – for class inheritance: class Dog extends Animal

**super** – to refer to the immediate parent class:

Call parent constructor: super(name, id);

Call parent method: super.sound();

**@Override** – annotation to indicate a method is overriding a parent method; helps catch mistakes at compile time.


## Super keyword

Used to:

Access parent class methods

Access parent class constructor

### What is method overriding? How is it related to inheritance?

Method overriding happens when a subclass provides its own implementation of a method already defined in its superclass, with the same name, return type, and parameters.

It’s possible only in inheritance and is the basis of runtime polymorphism: when we call a method on a parent reference, the subclass implementation runs at runtime

### Can a constructor be inherited?

No, constructors are not inherited, but parent constructors are called using **super()**.
