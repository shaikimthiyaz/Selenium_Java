# Abstraction

Abstraction is the OOP concept of **hiding internal implementation details** and **showing only the essential features**. 

### In Java, we achieve abstraction 

using **interfaces** and **abstract classes**.

The caller knows what a method does, not how it’s implemented

### Real-Life Example 

When you drive a car:

You use steering, brake, accelerator

You don’t know how the engine works internally

### Why Do We Need Abstraction?

Without abstraction:

❌ Code becomes complex

❌ User must know internal logic

❌ Hard to change implementation

❌ Low security

With abstraction:

✅ Simpler usage

✅ Loose coupling

✅ Better security

✅ Easy maintenance


## using abstract class

```
abstract class Payment {
    abstract void pay(double amount);
}
```

```
class CreditCardPayment extends Payment {
    void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid using Credit Card: " + amount);
    }
}
```

```
class UpiPayment extends Payment {
    void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid using UPI: " + amount);
    }
}
```

```
Payment payment = new UpiPayment();
payment.pay(500);
```

## Abstraction Using Interface

```
interface Animal {
    void sound();
}
```

```
class Dog implements Animal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

```
class Cat implements Animal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows");
    }
}
```

```
Animal a = new Dog();
a.sound();

Animal a= new Cat();
a.sound();
```


### abstraction vs encapsulation 

| Abstraction                           | Encapsulation                  |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Hides implementation                  | Hides data                     |
| Focus on functionality                | Focus on data protection       |
| Achieved via interface/abstract class | Achieved via private variables |
