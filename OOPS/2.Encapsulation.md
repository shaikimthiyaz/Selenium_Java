# Encapsulation

Encapsulation is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principle that:

Wraps data (variables) and code (methods) together into a single unit (class) and restricts direct access to the data.

### In Java, encapsulation is achieved by:

Making variables `private`

Providing controlled access using **public getter and setter methods**

### Real-World Example

ATM Machine Example

Think about an ATM:

You cannot touch the bank’s money directly

You can only use buttons like Withdraw, Deposit, Check Balance

ATM checks rules (PIN, balance, limits)

👉 This is Encapsulation.

### Why Do We Need Encapsulation?

With encapsulation:

✅ Data is safe
✅ Rules are applied
✅ Code is clean
✅ Easy to maintain
✔ Improves security
✔ Allows validation
✔ Makes code maintainable
✔ Supports loose coupling
✔ Easy to modify code


## Example:

Step 1: Make variables private

Step 2: Use public methods to access data

```
class Student {
    private int age;

    public void setAge(int age) {
        if (age > 0) {
            this.age = age;
        }
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }
	public static void main(String[] args) {

Student s = new Student();
s.setAge(20);
System.out.println(s.getAge());
}
}
```

### encapsulation vs data hiding

| Encapsulation        | Data Hiding              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Concept              | Technique                |
| Wrap data & methods  | Restrict access          |
| Achieved using class | Achieved using `private` |

Data hiding is part of encapsulation
